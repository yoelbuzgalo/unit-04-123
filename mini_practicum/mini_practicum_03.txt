Unit 03 Practice Problems

For the remainder of this semester, you will begin each new unit by solving a
set of practice problems based on the material from the previous unit. You will
have 30 minutes to complete your answers and push your solution to GitHub. 
Raise your hand if you need help.

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gage your preparedness for the exams.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. The numbered problems
below are weighted equally. 


1. Create a new Python module named "practice.py" and implement a function
   named "absolute_difference" which takes two integer parameters, a and b. Your
   function needs to calculate and return the absolute difference between a and
   b, i.e. the absolute value of the difference. For example, the absolute
   difference between 2 and 5 is 3.

   Your solution cannot use any math module functions.

2. Create a new Python module named "practice_test.py" and implement at least 3
   unit tests.

3. In your "practice.py" module, write a main function that generates two random
   integers between -100 (inclusive) and 100 (inclusive).  Use global constants
   for 100 and -100.  Call your absolute_difference function and print out the
   result.

   Match the output as closely as possible to
   
      a=2, b=5, absolute difference=3
